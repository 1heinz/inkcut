Introduction
    We envision a software application that can make it easy for a user to
    convert a vector design into a plottable, printable, or cutable material.
    A simple user interface with advanced features for adjustment to specific
    needs.

Positioning

Business Opportunity
    Other products are incompatible with operating systems other than windows,
    Their software is expensive, slow, and doesn't integrate with popular vector
    editors.  They often have a lot of complexity that is generally unused with
    very little error checking and notifications.  Very little information is
    provided prior to producing the job.

Problem Statement
    Other systems are incompatible, have strict requirements for their own editors
    and design programs and have errors or cause users to cut things that are
    not expected.  Many products require monthly payments for advanced features
    and/or software updates.

Product Position Statement
    The system is for users that want adaptibility at a low cost that is easy
    to use and understand. Quick and simple interfaces.
