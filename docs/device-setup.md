### Device Setup

Choose `Device -> Setup...` from the menu. Select your device driver from the list. 

> Note: If your device is not in the list, use the `Inkcut Generic Driver`. 

Select the `Connection` tab and choose the connection type. Finally choose the language your device uses in the `Protocols` tab. Click `Ok` to save your changes.

### Speed settings

Inkcut attempts to send data to the device at a rate that will not cause the device's data buffer to overflow on large jobs. 
For this to work properly it is important that the speed setting matches the actual device speed.

### Output rotation

You can change final output scaling and rotation that Inkcut uses for your device under the `Output` tab within the `Device` tab.
