Job and JobRequirements to SVG
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We need to be able to produce an SVG of only path elements (or possilby shapes
if that can be handled below)



SVG to Output Format Converstion
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For the device to plot, the svg file has to be converted into hpgl,gpgl or the
specific graphic language of the cutter.  The steps needed to achive this are:
    1. make a method to apply a matrix transformations to a path
    2. make methods to convert the pysvg shapes into paths
    3. make script to convert paths to hpgl that can also do the following:
        requirements:
           * blade offset compensation
           * overcut compensation
           * speed adjustment (variable)
           * force adjustment
           * final axis rotation and mirroring
