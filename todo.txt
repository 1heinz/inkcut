    SVG to Output Format Converstion
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    For the device to plot, the svg file has to be converted into hpgl,gpgl or the
    specific graphic language of the cutter.  The steps needed to achive this are:
        1. make a method to apply a matrix transformations to a path
        2. make methods to convert the pysvg shapes into paths
        3. make script to convert paths to hpgl that can also do the following:
            requirements:
               * blade offset compensation
               * overcut compensation
               * speed adjustment (variable)
               * force adjustment
               * final axis rotation and mirroring
    1. Write a script to convert SVG to Output - Not Started
        1. Open SVG file
        2. Set Device Axis Requirements
            1. Add transformations for axis rotation and mirroring
            2. Translate back to origin
            3. Apply Final Calibration scaling to path data
        2. Apply all transformations to path data
        3. Break all paths up into a list of single paths
        4. Set Device Cutting Requirements
            1. Set Blade Offset
            2. Set Overcut
        5. Create Output Data
            1. Set Cutting Force
            2. Set Cutting Speed/Speeds
            3. Set Cutting Order

3. Send to Device / Job Queue - Not Started

4. Import Output languages (HPGL,GPGL, etc) and convert back to SVG - Not Started

Job and JobRequirements to SVG
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We need to be able to produce an SVG of only path elements (or possilby shapes
if that can be handled below)
