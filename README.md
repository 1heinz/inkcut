### Donate and support

If you use Inkcut and want to help continue the development open source cutting software 
please consider [donating](https://www.codelv.com/projects/inkcut/support/). 

I would like to begin maintaining, updating, and adding new features to Inkcut on a 
regular basis, but I don't get paid to work on this so it's hard to justify spending 
the time.
